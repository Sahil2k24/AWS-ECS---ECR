# Building a Monitoring Solution with AWS ECS and ECR

I recently completed a project that involves setting up a monitoring solution using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the steps I followed.

## Introduction

AWS ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Docker. AWS ECR is a managed Docker container registry that simplifies storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images.

In this project, we will:
1. Create an ECS cluster.
2. Set up an ECR repository.
3. Launch an EC2 instance.
4. Configure the EC2 instance with AWS CLI and Docker.
5. Build and push a Docker image to the ECR repository.
6. Create a service and task definition in ECS.
7. Access the web service via the EC2 instance's IP address.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

**Creating an ECS Cluster**

First, I created an ECS cluster using the AWS Management Console. This involved choosing a cluster template, configuring the cluster name, and setting the required parameters.

**Setting Up an ECR Repository**

Next, I set up a repository in ECR to store my Docker images. This was done through the ECR section in the AWS Management Console by creating a new repository and naming it appropriately.

### 2. Configuring the EC2 Instance

**Launching an EC2 Instance**

I launched an EC2 instance, choosing an appropriate Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type. I configured the instance details and set up a security group to allow SSH and HTTP/HTTPS access.

**Installing Required Tools**

After launching the EC2 instance, I connected to it via SSH. I then installed Docker and configured the AWS CLI for streamlined interactions with AWS services.

### 3. Building and Pushing Docker Image

**Creating and Building the Docker Image**

I created a Dockerfile for my application, specifying the necessary configurations and dependencies. Afterward, I built the Docker image on the EC2 instance.

**Pushing the Image to ECR**

I tagged the Docker image and pushed it to my ECR repository. This ensures that the image is securely stored and ready for deployment.

### 4. Creating a Service with Task Definition

**Defining the Task**

In ECS, I created a task definition, specifying how my container should run within the ECS cluster. This included configuring resources, networking settings, and other parameters.

**Setting Up the Service**

Using the task definition, I created a service in ECS. This service ensures that the specified number of task instances run and are managed automatically.

### 5. Accessing the Web Service

Finally, I accessed the web service via the public IP address of the EC2 instance running the ECS task. This allowed me to monitor the application's performance and gather valuable metrics.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, I successfully set up a monitoring solution using AWS ECS and ECR. This project highlights the powerful integration of AWS services for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications efficiently.
